## Splat

Certain types of things are basically impossible to do in cross-platform
mobile code today, yet there's no reason why. Writing a ViewModel that handles
loading a gallery of pictures from disk will be completely riddled with
`#ifdefs` and basically unreadable. 

Splat aims to fix that, by providing a usable leaky abstraction above platform
code. It is leaky, because it always provides an extension method `ToNative()`
and `FromNative()`, which converts the abstraction to the platform-specific
version. Load the image in the cross-platform code, then call `ToNative()` in
your view to actually display it.

### What does it do?

Splat currently supports:

* Cross-platform image loading/saving
* A port of System.Drawing.Color for platforms that don't support it (WinRT,
  WP8)
* A way to detect whether you're in a Unit Test runner / Design Mode
